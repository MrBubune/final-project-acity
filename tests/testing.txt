How these tests map to objectives:

1. Broker protocol compliance:
- test_qos0_pubsub, test_qos1_handshake, test_qos2_handshake, test_lwt_and_clean_session
- Verify CONNECT/CONNACK, SUBSCRIBE/SUBACK, PUBLISH/PUBACK, PUBREC/PUBREL/PUBCOMP, wildcard, retain, LWT.

2. Embedded database & encryption:
- test_db_at_rest_is_encrypted ensures the on‑disk SQLite file is not plaintext.
- All integration tests exercise ACL lookups, retained storage, and logs.

3. Security:
- Clients must authenticate or are rejected (implicit in the tests).
- ACLs enforced in test_broker_pubsub.
- TLS is used by the clients in Publisher/Subscriber—if you disable certs in code, these would fail.

4. Admin UI:
- test_user_crud_and_acl_delete covers user creation, listing, ACL add & delete.
- test_live_logs_socketio verifies live WebSocket log streaming.
